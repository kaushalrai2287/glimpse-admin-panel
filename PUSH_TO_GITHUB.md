# Push to GitHub - Final Steps

✅ **Repository is ready!** All admin panel files have been committed.

## Next Steps:

### 1. Create the GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name**: `glimpse-admin-panel`
3. **Description**: `Admin panel for Glimpse event management system - Built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, and Supabase`
4. Choose **Private** or **Public**
5. **DO NOT** check any boxes (no README, .gitignore, or license)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2. Connect and Push

After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
cd "c:\Users\admin\OneDrive\Desktop\Glimpse"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/glimpse-admin-panel.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username** (e.g., `kaushalrai2287`)

So the full command would be:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/kaushalrai2287/glimpse-admin-panel.git
git push -u origin main
```
